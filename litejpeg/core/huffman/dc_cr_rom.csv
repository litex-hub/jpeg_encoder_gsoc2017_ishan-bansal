# DC_CR_ROM
# This module contains the encoded data for encoding the output from the RLE
# module after processing the chrominance modules made during the time of DCT
# and putting into a form which is universal and more general.
# The module is developed for the first input data of the matrix as the value of
# runlength is always 0 corressponding to that input and therefore the input data
# can goes to 11 for max which is the number of bits required to store the amplitude.
# These values are stored in the ROM as they remain the same throughout the
# process and are only required for the purspose of reading to form Huffman tables.
